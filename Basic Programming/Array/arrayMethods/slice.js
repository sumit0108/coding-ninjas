/**
 * slice() method slices out a piece of an array into a new array.
 *
 *Note
  The slice() method creates a new array.

  The slice() method does not remove any elements from the source array.

  The slice() method can take two arguments like slice(1, 3).

  The method then selects elements from the start argument, and up to (but not including) the end argument.
